
COMPILIING/HOOKING UDFs:

NOTE: 	This procedure does not work for all UDFs. See the FLUENT manual for 
		specifics on hooking procedure UDF macro.

1. Write UDF and save as .c file

2. Copy .c source file to working FLUENT directory (same containing .cas and .dat) 

3. Select SETUP from ANSYS WorkBench

4. Select USER DEFINED -> FUNCTIONS -> COMPILED...

5. Add UDFs to compile and click "Build"

6. Check if successful compilation

7. If successful then click "Load" to load library

8. Verify functions that are loaded

9. To "hook" select FUNCTION HOOKS using simple hook (only available for specified macros)

10. Click "Edit" next to macro name of desired UDF to hook

11. Select name of UDF to hook


NOTE: 	At this stage it is best to remove libraries and function hooks at end of 
		FLUENT session to prevent saving of metadata to project folder. This could
		cause errors if the UDFs are changed or removed between FLUENT sessions.
		
		FLUENT UDFs are compiled based on options when SETUP launched and therefore
		those compiled in parallel will not run in serial. Those compiled in serial
		will not run in parallel.
