Contains files related to ADJUST_PARTICLE_POS_VEL.c UDF.

UDF adjusts the particle velocity and position based on the current velocity and position. 

Current method not ideal but an example of some things that are possible.

A more accurate and dynamic model can be developed utilizing same parameters.

Thought:  Original idea was to adjust particle velocity by applying force based on surrounding density. 
          Would this cause problems because there are large air pockets present in the water phase that 
          would misrepresent particles in this phase as being in the air phase?
